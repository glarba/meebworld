judy you have really good judgement for these things so feel free to offer any criticism or other
ideas you have

better pathfinding

ore deposits mineable without tools but run out after a few uses, in their places quarries can be
built for infinite supply but pickaxe is needed

tree can be cut without tools but really slowly, axe can be made to cut it much faster

storage area, 2x2 tiles, meebs have to carry items they gather over to deposit it there

    will replace the wandering after stone gathering and make it look a lot more natural

    once building and crafting are introduced they will have to haul materials from storage

hunger system

furnace building made with stone to use coal as fuel
    
    smelt iron from ore

    cook food

docks buildable with wood to fish for food

farms for growing food

houses and reproduction, details not figured out yet
